# St.Art

Sometimes when I see street artworks on the streets, I wish I could take them home, or I think a certain place would be a great fit for them. So, I had this idea to create an online store concept web app for street artworks. This was also my very first development project that I built, and I used all vanilla stacks.

Stacks: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git.
